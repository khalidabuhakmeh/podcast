# Strongly Hyped Language

Strongly Hyped Language is a podcast that speaks with tech experts at a remarkably adept level. We are appealing to developers who want more for their time: More details, more tech, and more stories. We'll be deep diving into challenging topics like cryptography, timezones, microservice architectures, databases, and much more. Get an unfiltered peek into the minds of professionals that make the tech industry work. No fluff, just 30 minutes of great stuff.

Each Call...
==

- Invite Guest
- Create Github Issue
- Invite guest To join github issue
- Plan out a rough path for a 30 minute chat about something "interesting" (That's not a 'set' number)
- Ashton will setup a call with each guest + khalid at a convenient time for all
- We can record up to 2x the expected length of the podcast and ask as many questions as we like over that time, get the guest to re-phrase/repeat if/when necessary
- Ashton will edit out a lot of our chat where it doesn't add value - we may end up with more than one "section" at this point (Say, we asked a question and the subject matter jumped somewhere else)

- *after* the recording, we can record a brief intro/outro. If we ended up with more than one "section", we can do a quick voiceover for that too, rather than include a pile of back and forth in the talk itself. 

The goal should be to end up with something that isn't much more than 30 minutes long, goes deep and doesn't have too much else other than the guest talking away about something (This is not a vanity project for us hosts :) )
